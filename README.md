Trading Strategy Algorithm with RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands
This project implements a trading strategy using three technical indicators: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands.

Overview
The strategy generates buy and sell signals based on the following indicators:

RSI: Indicates overbought (sell) and oversold (buy) conditions.
MACD: Tracks the relationship between two moving averages and signals potential buy/sell opportunities.
Bollinger Bands: Measures market volatility and signals buy/sell opportunities based on price movements.
